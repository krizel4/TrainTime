# TrainTime Overview

This train application incorporates the use of Firebase to store train data, such as departure and arrival. The app retrieves and manipulates inputted information using Moment.js to calculate train frequencies, the next arrival, and the amount of time left until the next train arrives. Since this app has the information stored, information is up-to-date and "real time".

# Test the App
